# Profile-building Links

As a profile-building noob, this page will serve as a record
of what I learn about creating a profile `README.md` file.

[Return to Profile Page](README.md)

## Learning by Example

Having previously not paid much attention to profile pages,
I especially need to see some examples.

- [Abhishek Naiidu's Awesome Github Profile List](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme) is the first I found.  There's enough
here that I haven't explored further.
- [Kautuk Kundan's Awesome Profile README templates](https://github.com/kautukkundan/Awesome-Profile-README-templates)

## Display Resources

As green as I am, I don't know where people get their images.  I'm learning quickly.

## Shields

Those little information rectangles are often generated by third-party
web services.  The first shields I noticed were those that bragged about
certain web-page characteristics like conformance to certain web-standards.

### Skills Shields

I want my profile page to show my skills and experience.  There are several
ways to do this, starting with simple text to using various icons or shields.

Skills
- C
- C++
- Python
- BASH

#### Shields.io

[Shields.io](https://img.shields.io) offers an abundance of shields.  The following
skills list uses icon shields requested from shields.io:

![language](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?logo=c&message=c&color=66F&label=)  
![language](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?logo=C%2B%2B&message=C%2B%2B&color=66F&label=) 
( The pluses in C++ must be URL-encoded (+ = %2B) )

![label](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=languages:&color=grey)
